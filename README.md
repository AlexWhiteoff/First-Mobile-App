# React Native Pet Project

This project was created as a practice in mobile app development using React Native. It was a fascinating experience that helped explore basic concepts of UI/UX design, state management, and working with APIs.

## Project Overview

The application consists of three screens:

1. **Home Screen** – Displays the latest news fetched from an API.
2. **Gallery Screen** – Showcases a grid of images.
3. **Profile Screen** – Includes a simple registration form.

Features include:

- Data fetching from [GitHubusercontent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/) for news and images.
- **Skeletons** to enhance the user experience while content is loading.
- **Image fallbacks** that display default placeholders when images fail to load.

> **Note**: User authentication and data storage in a database are not implemented, as this project is focused on demonstrating skills and learning.

## Technologies

- **React Native**: Used to build the mobile app interface.
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Programming language for app logic.
- **GitHubusercontent API**: Source for fetching content.
